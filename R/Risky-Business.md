## **Summary**

This project uses web scraping, regex combinations and a labeling
mechanism to identify political violence risks in the emerging world, as
well as how their prevalence differs by continent and region. It uses
126 headlines from 60 different local newspapers.

 

## **Method**

**1) Scraping:**

A database of local newspapers in the emerging world is scraped three
times a week, beginning February 7 2022.

**2) Regex:**

Regex strings (including keywords, actor/action combinations and
hyperbolic situations) are used to create a series of word banks.

**3) Labeling:**

The word banks are then used to label headlines according to 5 political
violence risks before being manually checked/adjusted for accuracy.
