## **Summary**

This project uses web scraping, regex and a scoring mechanism to
identify the different kinds of political violence risks that occur in
the emerging world, as well as how their prevalence differs by continent
and region.

 

## **Method**

**1) Scraping:**

The websites of over 250 local newspapers in emerging regions are
scraped three times a week, beginning February 7 2022.

**2) Regex:**

A series of regex strings, including keywords, actor/action combinations
and hyperbolic situation scenarios, are used to create multiple word
banks.

**3) Scoring Mechanism:**

The word banks are used to score and label the headlines as one of 5
kinds of political violence risks.

**4) Z-scores:**

The relative distribution of risks is then compared using a standardized
score according to the relevant continent or region.
