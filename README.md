# Risky-Business

This project uses web scraping, regex and a labeling mechanism to
uncover the relative distribution of different violence risks in the
emerging world. The results include 822 risk headlines from 140 news sources. Just as Tom Cruise discovered in Risky Business,
those seeking to venture into the unknown could find things get out of
hand quickly if theyâ€™re not careful.
